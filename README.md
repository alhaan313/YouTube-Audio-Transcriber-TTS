This project automates the process of downloading a YouTube video, extracting its audio, transcribing it using Deepgram's API, and generating synthesized speech with ElevenLabs.

Features
Download YouTube videos and extract audio.
Transcribe audio using Deepgram's speech-to-text API.
Convert the transcript into audio using ElevenLabs' Text-to-Speech.
Automatically save the processed files in specified directories.
Project Structure
pytubefix: Used for downloading YouTube videos and extracting audio.
Deepgram API: Transcribes the extracted audio.
ElevenLabs API: Converts the transcript into synthesized audio.
pydub: Handles audio file conversion (e.g., from different formats to MP3).
